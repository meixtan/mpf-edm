I have heard you are having trouble making a decision on whether students should or shouldn't be required to do community service. I know many people who do community service including myself. From personal experience of community service i can tell you that it can help the way you think and act around certain types of people and ethnic groups. I am not say there is a different way to act around others, although it would be unprofessional to act like you do with your friends around the president of the United States. Therefore all students should be required to perform community service acts.

One of the main reasons community service should be essential is because students now a days have more time to do these things and it would greatly impact our communities. For example if one student did community service by picking up trash in a near by park we could prevent people from overseeing these parks just because it is has trash every where. Another great example of community service having a big impact on our community is helping at the annual food drive. This could impact millions of people that are in dyer needs of food and you never know but you could collect 5 cans that could possibly be the difference between life or death.

I know it may sound funny but picking up trash or collecting food at a food drive doesn't take much effort but it does leave a big impact and i know that students are age are perfectly capable of doing these small tasks.

Doing such a little thing to a community could make a big difference for many people, so if i were in your shoes trying to make a decision about community service i would definitely say yes not only because i do this myself but because the people that we could be effecting need our help. Thank you for considering the following things that i have put up to offer. I hope your decision goes well and i know when it comes down to it u will make the right choice.

Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to do community service. It is their choice. If they want to, they should but you can not force them to do so. I also believe that you should only make students who have gotten in trouble or been bad to do community service as punishment if you want to. This will help the community and make them learn their lesson. For an illustration, if a girl or a guy gets into trouble instead of giving them detention, just make them help out the world by doing some community service. This explains that it will benefit you and your world. This also illustrates that this punishment is better because in detention, you do nothing and just keep quiet but with this, they actually do something which would make them very sore and make them never want to do it again. I believe that detention rate might go down because of this. Time is very valuable which is why community service should be a choice.

People who do community services for free I believe should feel happy with themselves and shouldn't care what other people thinks. For a demonstration, if you have done something good and you friend told that it was a waist of time, you shouldn't care what they think. This explains that if you don't care, they might stop since people will stop if you show no reaction. This also explains that people can feel happy with what they do no matter what. This is why people shouldn't care about how people judges them.

Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to do community service. It is their choice. If they want to, they should but you can not force them to do so. I also believe that you should only make students who have gotten in trouble or been bad to do community service as punishment if you want to. This will help the community and make them learn their lesson. For an illustration, if a girl or a guy gets into trouble instead of giving them detention, just make them help out the world by doing some community service. This explains that it will benefit you and your world. This also illustrates that this punishment is better because in detention, you do nothing and just keep quiet but with this, they actually do something which would make them very sore and make them never want to do it again. I believe that detention rate might go down because of this. Time is very valuable which is why community service should be a choice.

People who do community services for free I believe should feel happy with themselves and shouldn't care what other people thinks. For a demonstration, if you have done something good and you friend told that it was a waist of time, you shouldn't care what they think. This explains that if you don't care, they might stop since people will stop if you show no reaction. This also explains that people can feel happy with what they do no matter what. This is why people shouldn't care about how people judges them.

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Take a position on this issue. Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class.

First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. ",6D21E6095A62, I believe,"try to avoid personal pronouns-since you are the writer it is clear you believe this, and it sounds more confident to just state it simply and directly",146,156,1718495347598,Persuasive,4,27,F,Hispanic/Latino,1,0,1,1,60.99,0.8214285714285714,0.008981620268618,0.5714285714285714,0.5,0.43130395,0,2,0,0,0,[0],[0],[0],0.4968177080154419,0.5014162659645081,0.505459189414978,1.8694527669301426e-05,0.501231054464976

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students.

so if we was to invent and sell computerized cars it could stop us from having so many wreaks plus it would also cause us to drive way safer. for instance if your drunk and you have to get home you just sit in the car and it will drive for you since you cant do it yourself because your not in the right stae of mind.

there is also the thought of making better roads but when you think about it that would cost more then a fortune to do. one other reason im all for this invention is because you know that the people making these cars are gonna earn a tone of money so that means more people will be switching to the new car instead of their old one. before you know it there will be somthing new and even better in technology since we just keep getting smarter over the years. who knows we might be driving hover craft later on in a few years because alot can be learned.

In the text the author says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too.""

Using details from the article, write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.","Would you want somthing that reads your emotions and finds out weather you are happy, sad or depressed. If so read more to find out some more information about this device to see if you would want this at your job or school.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weightign the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpice). Each expresstion is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

We has humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/hers face. Of course, msot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that the facial recognitinal machine works wonderfuly and would be amazing in any class room.

In conclustion, i belive that this device should be in schools all round that United States. My reasoning is when people come in the school that system can do backround checks on parents or adults that come into the buliding.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weightign the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpice). Each expresstion is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

We has humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/hers face. Of course, msot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that the facial recognitinal machine works wonderfuly and would be amazing in any class room.

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

IsptgwivswMcKuXygstJ,hs,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Take a position on this issue. Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Some school are offering classes were students can attend at home, the classes can be online or by video conferencing. Schools have been offering students classes that the students can take at home, but will it help the students? Some could see it both ways depending on the student, and how the student learns the best. Some students may benefit from attending classes from home, but some students may not.

Students may benefit from attending classes at home in the way, that some students may work better and or harder if they are working alone and one on one. There are students that know what they are doing and can figure it out on there own, but other students may not be able to. I do agree that the online classes may help some students, and some students may succeed in the classes.

Other students may not benefit from attending classes at home, some students may work better if they are with a teacher. There are many students that understand the material better if a teacher explains it to them one on one, or in a class. Students may find it easier to learn hands on, and have a teacher explain, and show them, and help the students understand the material.

Schools should offer classes that can be attend at home, because students can benefit from the classes taken at home. Also schools should let the student decide rather he or she would like to take the online classes, no school should just assign a student an at home class if he or she dose not want the class.

Venus is the hottest planet out there; although Mercury is the clostes to the sun venus is still the hottset plantet in our solar system. Venus temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit.

Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Take a position on this question. Support your response with reasons and specific examples.,"Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.

As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.

However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will ""slack off"" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of ""what is the effect of temperature on ice?"" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.

In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too ""obvious"" or easy.

Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.

However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will ""slack off"" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of ""what is the effect of temperature on ice?"" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.

In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too ""obvious"" or easy.

Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher.

They think helping the community is very important. But other friends of yours think community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. 
Your principal is deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. 
Write a letter to your principal in which you take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service. Support your position with examples.","Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, I believe you should require all students to preform community services at SCHOOL_NAME. I believe this for many reasons. The first reason being is that there are hundreds of kids at our school, and if each person does one community service , that doesn't even have to be big, think of how that could all add up! We could be changing the community one step at a time. When I say the service doesn't have to be big, I mean the smallest things such as throwing a couple of plastic bottles in a recycling bin or picking up some litter you see on the side of the street or in you neighborhood. My second reason being is there are some elderly people in Austintown that could use some help with simple everyday things, such as getting their mail or shoveling their driveway. Just doing those little things for a neighbor or friend could leave a great impression on Austintown children. But adults aren't the only ones that need help. There are elementary school children that struggle in school, such as math or any subject at all. As sixth, seventh, and eighth graders we should be good role models and help them with their weaknesses. We could tutor them after school for an hour making sure we get progress done. I understand that some students have after school activities, such as a sport event, so they would not be required to tutor. But it would be mandatory for them to do some type of service, such as picking up litter everyday. When all of these community services add up, we will be influences for Canfield and Boardman and other cities and they will do the same. When we come together like this, we can make a difference. Some students that disagree with this may thing the community is no big deal, but it is much more bigger than they think. Remember, a clean community is a happy community and when we all come together we can make a difference. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you take it into consideration.

Sincerely,

I don't think it is a good idea to change the grade point average that is required to participate in sports.

Some of the players would get kicked off the team because they just have a C and that could effect the whole team.

It could also effect your school because maybe the players are just so stressed from having to try to get a B instead of just a C.

A C is still a good grade.

A C is still passing and it shows that the person may not understand but he still try's.

When I get a C its because I tried but i don't quite understand the information.

I know a lot of kids that would be happy with just a C and they actually try in class.

My friend was on the basketball team and he got decent grades.

I remember that when projects came up he would be really stressed and I would help him out with his school work.

He would try but on certain things he felt like it was just way to hard.

Imagine if he had to get B' s, he would have been all stressed all the time and it was hard for him to just to get good enough grades just to be able to play a sport that he really loved.

Some kids are stressed and they don't really have to get grades good enough to play any sport.

I try for good grades and its easy because I have all the time after school to do my homework or maybe just work on a project that will be due.

The players on the team have to go to practice and then after that they do there homework but I would think they would be tired from having to practice for about on hour.

The players have a lot to handle and raising what grades they have to have in order to play ,may just make them quit.

If they get lazy they can say they going to take the class later. if they want to watch a movie they going to forge thinks about the class. They can get distracted for anything like the phone,music,and the TV.Attend class from home would not benefit students if they want to hang out with their frinds they can leave the class in any moment unlike if they have a teacher giving the the class in the school they can respect the class,put more antention,and understand better the class.

However NASA has evidence that this Face was no created by aliens but natural landforms.

This photo taken by, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC),revealed that the Face was only natural landform. Of course everyone was not satisafied, believeing that alien markings were hidden by haze.

But mission controllers looked again, with some hard work, and only gained more facts that the natural landforms made more sense about how the Face got on Mars. Its turns out natural landforms are common around the American West. Also just another reason to have believed NASA is that the buget defenders wished there was an anicent civilization, so if there where Aliens dont you think NASA would have been making money off of the rumor if it were true.

I know this is just a natural landform. Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West."" Then to prove it even more it says this. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar."" So that just said that these ""faces"" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.

MY POSITIONING ON COMMUNITY SERVICE IS THIS: WOULD YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WE MAY HAVE TO INHABIT ANOTHER PLANET BECAUSE OUR OWN PLANET IS FILLED WITH LITTER? THIS COULD HAPPEN, AND YES, IT MIGHT MAKE THIS SEEM MISLEADING, BUT THATS NOT THE POINT. WE SHOULDNT BE FORCED TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE. PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WORK IN COMMUNITY SERVICE FIGHT FOR

THEIR CAUSE, AN OTHER SUPPORTERS CAN STAND UP AND HELP. FORCING SOMEONE TO HELP

A CAUSE SHOULD BE AGINST THE CONSTITUTION. IF YOU WISH NOT TO FOLLOW, YOU DONT SHOULDNT HAVE TO. FORCING PEOPLE TO FIGHT AGINST A CAUSE THEY DONT WANT TO IS TAKING AWAY THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE, WHICH SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED. BUT, AS IN A CASE SUCH AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN SENTANCED BY A JUDGE TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR DAMAGE TO THE COMMUNITY, I CAN NOT SAY THAT IS WRONG. BUT EVEN THOUGH I SEE IT AS A BAD IDEA TO FORCE SOMEONE TO DO IT, I DIDNT SAY IT SHOULDNT BE A CLASS OF SOME SORT, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU CAN GET CREDITS FOR HELPING PICK UP TRASH, OR HELP KIDS IN ELEMENTARY WITH WORK OF SOME SORT. IN

MIDDLE SCHOOL, WE COULD GET EXTRA CREDIT FOR ONE CLASS BY DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE. THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT SOLUTION, MORE PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO HELP, THROUGHOUT SCHOOLS. WE COULD AVOID THE FUTURE OF HAVING TO INHABIT ANOTHER PLANET, BUT WITHOUT FORCING PEOPLE TO HELP. THATS MY POINT. WE CAN DO EVERYTHING EFFICIANTLY, AND DO IT PEACEFULLY, AT THE SAME TIME.

I think that performing community service should be required because it will teach students that go to our school to be kind and giving back to the community will make them feel better. I also think it should be necessary because it will teach the students to be giving and it could change their personality in a positive way. I also think it would be good because some students might think it will be fun cleaning up, and you don't have to do it alone i am sure you would be able to do it with a friend.

Not all students enjoy doing community service or helping out other people. Yes it would be nice if some of them did take the time out to help. If you asked me for my option on this I would say no. For example some students might have to go home and watch their little brother/sister, and just don't have the time. While other kids might have a sport they play in and they have practice.

If you made everybody perform community service it would be crazy. Like I said before not only do students have things to do, but they might already be involved in an activity. As a student

I don't have time to do some things due to homework. Now just think would you rather for us to complete a certain amount of community service or get an education? Now once which one would you rather us do? Yes of course get an education! I know If I was you I would want my students to complete all their work, and then worry about staying after for school.

Now if the student had a little extra time maybe he/she might want to help the kids at the elementary school or even go volunteer at the animal shelter. Say a student jus got a call from their mother and it was a family emergency what do you expect them to do then? Yea giving back by helping another by student is a good idea, but not all kids have the time. Once again TEACHER_NAME my opinion on all students have to do community service is no.

Not all students enjoy doing community service or helping out other people. Yes it would be nice if some of them did take the time out to help. If you asked me for my option on this I would say no. For example some students might have to go home and watch their little brother/sister, and just don't have the time. While other kids might have a sport they play in and they have practice.

If you made everybody perform community service it would be crazy. Like I said before not only do students have things to do, but they might already be involved in an activity. As a student

I don't have time to do some things due to homework. Now just think would you rather for us to complete a certain amount of community service or get an education? Now once which one would you rather us do? Yes of course get an education! I know If I was you I would want my students to complete all their work, and then worry about staying after for school.

Community Service is a very important aspect of life.

As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service.

As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians?

Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God.

I have done community service with my peers and during my experiences, I have encountered many people from various ages, genders, races, and social classes.

From every trip I have gained a valuable experience.

During one of my experiences, I was working in a soup kitchen in downtown Cleveland.

Although intimidating at first, I helped by serving those who didn't have the same gifts I am blessed with.

Isn't that what we are called to do?

Serve others like Jesus did?

I learned from this that every human person is valuable and should be treated with dignity and respect.

Wouldn't you like all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in such a great journey of faith and attempt to carry out what we are taught by Jesus Christ?

I believe by helping our society to become a better place is why we are put here on this earth, but we shouldn't be wasting our time and talents by selfishly keeping our gifts to ourself.

We are called to share those gifts with others.

Simply, I am asking that you implement at least ten hours of community service for the entire school year.

That is only a little over an hour of community service per month.

By doing this, we will come closer to God and to those around us.

Seagoing Cowboys lets you stay with animals when you ride in the boat. When I was working, I got to work with animals such as horses and cattle. There are many animals to work with. There are also many things that you must do for the animals. You must feed them, water them, and clean out their stalls. The animals usually eat oats or wheat. Animals can be hard work, but they can also give you something fun to do.

Seagoing Cowboys program is all by sea. You pick up the animals on land and then, you set sail and hit the water. If you have never ridden in a boat, then I suggest that you take this oppertunity in life. Boats can be very fun. They rock back and forth like a rocking chair and float on water. Boats are proably the most important thing that we need for the journey. If we did not have the boats, then we are out of luck.

If you have never seen any national landmark, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to try to see a landmark. On the trips I have taken, I have gotten to see the Acropolis, parts of China, and have done and seen many other things. One of my favorites was riding in a gondola, in the city of water, Venice. The landmarks are important because they remind us of friendship. For example, France gave us the Effiel Tower to us as a peace treaty? Well, now you know.

The Seagoing Cowboy program lets you be with animals, get to ride on a boat, and gives you the oppertunity to see national landmarks like the Great Wall of China.

Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Take a position on this question. Support your response with reasons and specific examples.,"When summer break starts most students only think about the fun they are going to have over those 3 months. They don't think about learning or gaining knowledge over this period of time. In addition, students forget what they have learned over the course of the long school year. A great way for students to learn while on summer break is to be assigned summer projects. These projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year.

Although, students can be creative in making summer projects for themselves, teachers are better equipped for this task. A teacher makes lesson plans all year so students can learn and pass semester exams. Summer projects can be a cool and fun way to learn. For example, students can create a big poster or PowerPoint displaying all of the things they have learned in school that year. If a student were to create a summer project then they might take it easy on themselves instead of doing something challenging. However, a teacher will give their students a challenge so they can think and problem solve.

Each year students learn the same thing that they learned the previous year, however, they build on what they have learned. This is why it's important for students to stimulate their brains over the summer so the information is not lost or forgotten. If teachers assigned projects to students over the summer then they would have information fresh on their brains ready to use next year.

Consequently, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year. These projects are a great way for students to learn and grow over the summer instead of playing video games.",CC059B14457A,"These projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year.

It will help the teacher know what their students are feeling. Teachers will know more about their students, and will be able to form a closer bond with them. The FACS system will help the teacher understand what the student need more help with, and what they are more intrrested in.

The FACS system can read the facial muscles, and this is how it can detacte the emotions of people. It can even identify when someone has mixed emotions, and compares each expression with a neutral face. This is how it can regoinze when students are feeling bored, confused, or any other emotion.

Pk6zgcaEVhK9EEixEngf,hs,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Take a position on this issue. Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too.

On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",2F3210D23414,"Students now can take classes from their houses.

She would like to hear the students' views on this possible policy change. Write a letter to your principal arguing for or against requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Be sure to support your arguments with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

You asked for student's opinions on the subject of the new school rule that concerns whether students should be able to participate in after-school activities or sports if they have a C or lower average. I do think this is a good idea. This new rule can be a motivation for students who slack off in school, and now they can have a reason to work harder.

A grade of a C is a passing grade, so students think it's all right to not work any harder because they're already passing. However, a C is not what students should strive for. Taking away privileges, such as after-school activities or sports, is an excellent way to make students work harder to get a B. However, I do think you should either allow them to go to study sessions or start study groups to help them achieve and maintain a B or an A.

In addition, this would help our whole school learn things faster, because students will have to work to receive maintain a B or an A, unlike when they had a C. Although this might cause the sports teams or school clubs to lose members, I think it is worth it. I believe that students should be more concerned about their grades than their clubs or sports. I also think that parents would be more proud of their children for trying harder in school because of the motivation.

Also, teachers would be happier with the students because they are working harder. If the students pay more attention in class and do their homework, and stay after for extra help, the teachers will be happier and more encouraging because the students are trying hard. Furthermore, the students with a C average will learn that they have to work hard to achieve a goal, and that maintaining a B or an A average takes work and determination.

Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

Students who aren't comfortable in a noisy environment cant express themselves in class,but if you take classes online you get to express yourself for example video confrence you get to express yourself and ask good question with good explanation. Because everybody has a way of learning some students adapt quick and others learn slowly,but taking this one on one course helps you adapt really quick because you are alone in a quite environment which is going to help you adapt really quick! Online classes also helps because some students have a hard time waking up early in the morning to school which causes you to be late everytime,being late can lead you to detention,saturday school and other things.

Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Students that receive online classes at home and cannot attend to school is not benefit to learn. Being at home can get distracted and it is not the same in school to receive classes with a teacher who can help and have the attention of students for better explanations. As the video conferencing does not develop social and how speak with smartness.

First at all, online does not benefit students to the education and the culture to learn. It is not the same way to ask questions to teachers to obtain specifics answers and explanations. At the same time, the brain need to develop in socialize with people around us. As example, students who cannot speak English very well, it is important to attend classes in school to socialize and speak more for develop language.

Another reason, the education of students can relate with respect to others and show the culture of education that teachers in school gives every day and it is better than distance learning.

Generic_Name informed his dad about going out and he said to travel with a few of his friends, due to kidnappings in the area he didn't want Generic_Name to be alone at the park.

The first example is that multiple opinions can help you make safer choices. Like with Generic_Name, going out with people you know is a great way to stay safe. Doing things in broad daylight helps as well. Unfortunately many kidnappings and random shootings are happening presently. Following all of this advice could help a simple walk to the corner store just that much safer.

Secondly, taking in multiple opinions help people make smarter decisions too. Referring back to the introduction when Generic_Name's brother told him to survey the area and watch for any strange activity was an amazing idea.

You also always want to know where you are at all times. It's also important to know where every exit and entrance available in any public setting.

Generic_Name informed his dad about going out and he said to travel with a few of his friends, due to kidnappings in the area he didn't want Generic_Name to be alone at the park. Generic_Name also told his older brother about him leaving the house for a bit and he said to watch the area for anything suspicious and that if he did see something, that Generic_Name and his friends should head home immediately. Thanks to his family, Generic_Name and his friends got home safe and sound. Listening to multiple opinions can help people make safer and smarter decisions.

The first example is that multiple opinions can help you make safer choices. Like with Generic_Name, going out with people you know is a great way to stay safe. Doing things in broad daylight helps as well. Unfortunately many kidnappings and random shootings are happening presently. Following all of this advice could help a simple walk to the corner store just that much safer.

Secondly, taking in multiple opinions help people make smarter decisions too. Referring back to the introduction when Generic_Name's brother told him to survey the area and watch for any strange activity was an amazing idea. Watching for people that are acting out of the ordinary is a helpful tip, because if that person were to do something weird knowing who exactly it is your getting away from is a good thing. You also always want to know where you are at all times. It's also important to know where every exit and entrance available in any public setting.

In summary, listening to the advice of multiple people is a way to stay safe and make educated decisions. If Generic_Name were to just leave the house without speaking to his dad or brother, who knows what could have happened. The safety of you and your peers is a major priority. Everyone should get a second opinion on as many things as possible. ",B4BD4DD677AD,mportant to know where every exit and entrance available in any public setting.,This example doesn't really fit the paragraph topic - revise,1572,1651,1718985443925,Persuasive,4,10,F,Black/African American,1,0,0,1,36.96,1.0,0.0023722018598415,0.7272727272727273,0.0,0.55800545,0,0,0,0,0,[0],[0],[0],0.5015023946762085,0.5036233067512512,0.5077174305915833,9.981131579905878e-06,0.5042810440063477

I think that helping the community is a good thing to do for the school. Cleaning up or picking up the trash from side walks, the grass, from rivers or lakes or anything like that. We could learn lots of things like math like picking up one plus two more makes three. We could do science by saying their are so many germs and different kind of germs and what could they be.

It is important to pick up litter so that the earth wont get polluted. If we don't pick up the litter its going to effect the earth. We could also take half that wants to pick up litter and let them pick it up for maybe a hour or two.

Then we can get the other half that didn't, let them do work until the other half came. When they did the half that didn't want to pick up litter, they could have their work finished and let them pick up litter for an hour or two. But if that wouldn't work we could start a club or a meeting after school for the students that wanted to pick up litter come and join the club.

If it helps the earth from pollution or anything bad happening to the earth i think we should help the community. I think we should do it so it wouldn't make our school look bad in any way. so people wont think that we don't care about our school. so i think helping the community is a good idea.

Dear principal,

I hear that you are deciding whether or not to make community service required in our school. I don't think that you should do this and I have many reasons why.

My first reason is that doing community service is supposed to make you feel good and make you feel like your doing something really nice out of the goodness of your heart. However, by making students do community service you are going to take that feeling away. They will be forced to do it and will not feel accomplished. They will feel like its a chore. When they grow up and they aren't required to do community service anymore they probably won't. As where a student who is not forced to do community service will probably grow up not thinking of it as a chore. They probably have a better chance of doing community service when they grow up too.

My second reason is that when children are forced to do something they don't do it as well as they could've. They will act spoiled and will not even bother to help in the community service. They will treat it like a chore and not even care about what there doing or how there doing it. They will cause a problem and may hurt someone. You have to want it and if you don't than your not going to work hard for it.

My third and final reason as to why I think you shouldn't make us all do community service is simply because me and my fellow classmates need to figure this stuff out on our own. Just as you and your family did.

We need to learn that life isn't all about us. We need to learn that we can't be selfish, and we have to think of other less fortunate people who can't afford anything we have and that we have to help them. Or we have to clean up the town a little. You have to let us figure this out on our own. Just as everybody else did. It will help us in the end.

These are all of the reasons why I strongly believe that you should not require us to do community service. I thank you for taking the time to read this message and hope that you will make a good decision.

Dear principal,

I hear that you are deciding whether or not to make community service required in our school. I don't think that you should do this and I have many reasons why.

My first reason is that doing community service is supposed to make you feel good and make you feel like your doing something really nice out of the goodness of your heart. However, by making students do community service you are going to take that feeling away. They will be forced to do it and will not feel accomplished. They will feel like its a chore. When they grow up and they aren't required to do community service anymore they probably won't. As where a student who is not forced to do community service will probably grow up not thinking of it as a chore. They probably have a better chance of doing community service when they grow up too.

My second reason is that when children are forced to do something they don't do it as well as they could've. They will act spoiled and will not even bother to help in the community service. They will treat it like a chore and not even care about what there doing or how there doing it. They will cause a problem and may hurt someone. You have to want it and if you don't than your not going to work hard for it.

My third and final reason as to why I think you shouldn't make us all do community service is simply because me and my fellow classmates need to figure this stuff out on our own. Just as you and your family did.

We need to learn that life isn't all about us. We need to learn that we can't be selfish, and we have to think of other less fortunate people who can't afford anything we have and that we have to help them. Or we have to clean up the town a little. You have to let us figure this out on our own. Just as everybody else did. It will help us in the end.

These are all of the reasons why I strongly believe that you should not require us to do community service. I thank you for taking the time to read this message and hope that you will make a good decision.

How are you doing today? I would like to give you my opinion on kids doing community service. I think it is a good idea for kids to do community service despite what they want to do. Community service shows discipline, dedication, and leadership. Today I will be explaining why I think community service should be required for all students. Please sit back, relax, and read along.

The first reason why I think students should be required to do community is because it teaches discipline. It teaches discipline because it keeps you focus and not letting you get caught up. For example, there is so many negative things going on these days, and if you are doing something good with your time, you don't have time for the negativity. It also shows discipline because community service is something that you have to do consisting, so community service is something that you have to do, and be dedicated to doing it. This is my first reason why I think all students should be required to do community service.

Next, community service teaches students how to be a good citizen. By doing community service for along time, eventually students will start picking up trash, helping people, and things like that when their not doing community service. They do those things because that is just the person they have become from doing community service. Community service teaches a lot of good things and how to be good citizen is one of them. Citizenship is a great quality to have.

9bZWAhMiuXA6FtwF9J2N,ms,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Take a position on this question. Support your response with reasons and specific examples.,"I believe school summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects will help a student express their creativity, it will be less complicated, and it will let them learn about a topic they are interested in. If the project is student-designed, it is most likely for them to keep up with it and not set it aside. Students should be trusted to build something on what they learned on their own.

Even though not all students come up with astonishing ideas, all of them have the capacity to be creative. Creativity is important when it comes to projects. It helps a project look presentable, it also helps the audience gain interest. Students can let their imagination discover more ideas when a project is not teacher-designed because their options are not limited. Not only will it be more exciting to do a project, but it will increase students' grade by showing their creativity.

A student-designed project will relieve stress from students by being able to create whatever they please. Instead of having to assemble something difficult given by a teacher, a student will choose an easier option for themselves, so they will not build up pressure. Since they will most likely pick a non difficult idea, they can complete their project faster. Therefore, students will enjoy their summer break more.

Furthermore, most students will choose an option they are intrigued in, which makes a project become more interesting. Students will pick one out of a variety that they enjoy; they will stay on task. For example, the more engaged the students are to their project the more it will help them stay focused. When they pick a topic they like, the project becomes more simple to make because it is genuine or sincere.

Given all these points, summer projects should be designed by students. It will make it more easier for the students to work on and more interesting for the teacher to read.

Using details from the article, create an argument for or against the development of these cars.  Be sure to include: your position on driverless cars; appropriate details from the article that support your position; an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to your argumentative essay.","Would it not be nice to have car that will drive and navigate itself? Driverless cars are the transportation of the future. In 2009, Google had already created a car that was almost completely independent and, many other companies such as General Motors had created similar cars. These cars have many unknown variables that still need to be worked out but, driverless cars will be a positive change towards the future.

Scientist have been working on creating a driverless car for years. As of 2009, Google created an almost independent car. The car could do almost anything. the downfall was that the car still relied on driver control in situations such as traffic construction zones. These cars have alert systems to alert the driver when human assistance is needed. Therefor these cars are still safe to operate but not completely independant.

The majority of the driverless cars being invented today have a great deal of sensors.

These sensors allow the cars to distinguish thier surroundings, giving the most amount of safety possible. These cars are also more fuel efficient and eco friendly. They will use less fuel and will be equipped with many safety features. These new features allow the car to see 360 degrees around the vehicle and keep the passenger as safe and comfortable as posible.

As of now, many of these cars still need human attention when driving. They are equipped with vibrating seats and sensors on the wheel to monitor that the human is alert. Eventually these cars will be able to navigate through all situations without any human support. This will allow passengers to enjoy the ride and drive longer distances faster. As well as maintaining confidence in thier safety.

These cars will allow passengers to utilize thier time more efficiently by allowing them to use the time they usually spend driving doing something else.

Driving is not for everyone.

Driverless car will prevent many accidents due to people mistake. Which are normal we make mistakes, But with the vechile watching our steps or even driving for us would be a benfit for that driver.

Google states ""google cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"". The cars aren't compeletly driverless; they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? your probably asking, although, the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires such as navigating through work zones and around accidents, until then they are free to text with a cell phone, call someone withour stoping. In this way, the driverless car is actually a safety feature.

How the car does this is with position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.

But the most important piece is the LIDAR(spinning sensor on the roof), it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all is necessary for the driverless car to replicate the skill of a person at the wheel.

Even when the car require the driver aid, displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays.

Over all I see benfit in having driverless cars, They driverless cars allow us to complete as task such as putting on make up or text messaging someone, but they can still allow us to take over if needed.

I have been to many different countries like Europe, Greece, China, Italy, and Crete! You could see these sites too if you join the sea cowboys program too.

It is also a very good way to make friends to. I have made friends with the people on the boats with me and the people i meet in different countries. Taking care of the animals was a great way for me to pass the time and helping my aunt Katie's farm made it alot easier. We arrived in Europe right after the pacific war. After Europe we packed our animals and headed up to Greece. I turned 18 before reaching greece so i was old enough to get drafted into the millitary, But they told me that i should just keep doing what im doing. The sea cowboys program is a great way to do millitary service to. .

Being a sea cowboy is more than an adventure, It helped me see the world and know exactly what is going on in other contries. I think you should join the sea cowboy program because it would be a learning experience for all.

Your idea about all students having to do community service is a wonderful idea. Now of days people just throw stuff on the ground thinking its not a big deal, but it is.

They think helping the community is very important. But other friends of yours think community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. 
Your principal is deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. 
Write a letter to your principal in which you take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service. Support your position with examples.","Dear Principle,

Your idea about all students having to do community service is a wonderful idea. Now of days people just throw stuff on the ground thinking its not a big deal, but it is. If all people do is just throw garbage on the streets it will make the Earth look like a garbage dump. It is also bad for our environment. Animals eating it thinking its food and choking to death. Then if people throw it into the water the fish die from it. If students get involved it'll make the world or there town cleaner. then plants, and animals won't die from the waste that comes from the garbage. if you want students to do community service I'm okay with this idea. I'm sure all the other students would be fine with this to.

I also have another idea on getting them to do so. give the assignments as homework. Each day you assign the assignment make this the only homework you give them so they would do it. By doing this it'll give them something to do that doesn't require having to think. It'll also make them like recycling and helping the environment.

In conclusion, I believe making students do community service is a good idea.

Taking extracurricular activities can increase work and responsibility, take time away from more important areas, or even cause stress. A student should only take an extracurricular activity if they know that they'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can negatively affect the student in many ways.

Taking an extracurricular activity means more work, and considering the amount of work students already have, it can be overwhelming. Many students won't be able to complete all their assignments because of the extra activity. This can lead to lower grades and worst performance in other classes. Not only will students have more work, they will also have to manage their time in order to be able to consistently participate or show up for that activity.

You might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong, but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. When students take extracurricular activities, they take away from their free time in order to put it in their schedule. Students use their free time to do their homework, relax from work, or spend with their family. This is pretty important for a student, considering that this may stress them out.

For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Do you agree or disagree with this decision? Use specific details and examples to convince others to support your position.","Should students be forced to take an extracurricular activity? I don't take they should for many reasons. Taking extracurricular activities can increase work and responsibility, take time away from more important areas, or even cause stress. A student should only take an extracurricular activity if they know that they'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can negatively affect the student in many ways.

Taking an extracurricular activity means more work, and considering the amount of work students already have, it can be overwhelming. Many students won't be able to complete all their assignments because of the extra activity. This can lead to lower grades and worst performance in other classes. Not only will students have more work, they will also have to manage their time in order to be able to consistently participate or show up for that activity.

You might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong, but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. When students take extracurricular activities, they take away from their free time in order to put it in their schedule. Students use their free time to do their homework, relax from work, or spend with their family. This is pretty important for a student, considering that this may stress them out. This leads into our final reason.

The increased amount of work and responsibility, combined with managing time efficiently, can be enough to overwhelm student to the point where they get stressed. Students might not be able to keep up with all the work they get from their extracurricular activity plus all their other classes. As stated before, this can lower grades, and force students to take time away from those classes just to focus on their extracurricular activity. Stress is very serious problem already, and it can be beneficial not to force a student to participate in an activity that they don't want to do.

In conclusion, taking an extracurricular activity can have negative affects. It starts with unnecessary work, which leads to taking time away from other things, which finally leads to stress. Many students already do extracurricular activities, mainly because they enjoy it. But some students need time to focus on other things they might find more important, which isn't a bad thing. Students shouldn't be forced to join an activity, but they should always have the option to.",E51DC9CFC464," It starts with unnecessary work, which leads to taking time away from other things, which finally leads to stress.",Good -- summarizing your stated reasons,2041,2156,1719346417164,Persuasive,4,6,M,Asian/Pacific Islander,0,0,0,1,32.56,1.0,0.00147547402665,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.49380487,0,1,0,0,0,[0],[1],[1],0.5099377632141113,0.5238538384437561,0.5249454379081726,7.001317315176911e-05,0.51957901318868

Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. 
Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.
Write a letter to your principal convincing her which policy you believe is better. Support your position with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.

Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost ""dared"" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.

The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.

One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.

I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.

Another reason I think people should join is to have fun. I say that because while you are at sea you could explore different places around the world. While being a seagoing cowboy, I visited places like Europe and China while i was working as a seagoing cowboy. I also went to Greece to see an Acropolis, and I even went to an excavated castle in Crete. When the animals are unloaded you could play many things such as Table-tennis, baseball, volleyball, and many more in the empty holds where the animals were.

My first reason is being able to travel to all these different countries and knowing your helping someone in need. This program is to bring animals to countries that need these anamils to survive. We are needing extra help to save all these children and family's in need.

Any shift you are working you get nice things like if you work morning shift you get the beautiful sunrise. While you are working you get all these extra nice things, I'm sure you'll love it.

I believe that if students had to make the decision to take classes online or come to school, they would most likely pick school but personally i'd be the one taking the online classes. Besides some of the teens nowadays would recommend online, but then again the middle school and below would rather be at school because they are younger and into school while teens prefer to be at work or hanging out with an friend. Therefore that opportunity would have defiantly been token advantage of well by the teens. Because the younger kids arent really to worried about being home or hanging out because all of there friends and fun are at school not at home.

In my opinion, high school should be online classes only; Because at this point if you look at the results on how many children actually come to school when theyre in high school vs when theyre in middle school/elementary it would be a big difference in attendance records. everyone would literally be passing because its online an you dont have to come to school you can literally lay in your bed and do your work. Besides your gonna have a lot of time on your hands because your not in a school you dont have to switch classes, eat lunch, go to the locker, class changes none of that so you have a lot of time to complete all of your work.

So therefore if my school offered online classes, that would be greatly token advantage of by me and most of the students that go here. The teachers wouldnt even have worry about the work not getting done.

I believe that if students had to make the decision to take classes online or come to school, they would most likely pick school but personally i'd be the one taking the online classes. Besides some of the teens nowadays would recommend online, but then again the middle school and below would rather be at school because they are younger and into school while teens prefer to be at work or hanging out with an friend. Therefore that opportunity would have defiantly been token advantage of well by the teens. Because the younger kids arent really to worried about being home or hanging out because all of there friends and fun are at school not at home.

In my opinion, high school should be online classes only; Because at this point if you look at the results on how many children actually come to school when theyre in high school vs when theyre in middle school/elementary it would be a big difference in attendance records. everyone would literally be passing because its online an you dont have to come to school you can literally lay in your bed and do your work. Besides your gonna have a lot of time on your hands because your not in a school you dont have to switch classes, eat lunch, go to the locker, class changes none of that so you have a lot of time to complete all of your work.

I am STUDENT_NAME, an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME. I disagree with your plan to require a 'B' average in classes to participate in sports. Many students are smart and apply themselves, but do not fully understand subject material.

Do not think that they are not trying to get a good grade; They just need more help understanding the material. I know many very smart students who have difficulty with a certain subject. they care about getting a good grade, and want to do well. Not many of the se people play sports, but this new policy you have proposed will still affect them. Many students have a 'C', and they just need to get better help for that. I believe that doing sports helps a student get better grades, as they have a drive to continue, so as not to get kicked off their team. They will also have time to exercise and stretch while playing sports, which increases cardiovascular activity. You yourself said that ""The best way to prepare is to get your blood pumping through cardiovascular activity"".

Blood flow increases cognitive activity, which will help students achieve better grades because they will understand the subject matter better. Sports allow students to take a break from school and have some time with their friends. They will want to stay with their freinds, so they have another motive to try harder and get good grades.

I am STUDENT_NAME, an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME. I disagree with your plan to require a 'B' average in classes to participate in sports. Many students are smart and apply themselves, but do not fully understand subject material.

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowboys program. I mean,why wouldn't he,he had a great time there and he thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

Another example is in the last paragraph when he said that he was gretful for the opportunity to be a Seagoiong Cowboy. Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that he is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowboy and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

I have another piece of evidence since you still don't believe me. He also says that Luke also had fun on board. This piece of evidence just proves that he had a good time just being on the boat.

The two terms given are policies that both have reasonable pros and cons to each subject.

On the other hand, banning cell phones from school at any time and at any hour is another choice.

Although these policies hold different views and opinions to them, letting students carry cell phones in school should be authorized.

In any case of an emergency, students who are allowed to have a cell phone during lunch breaks and other free time can contact those in times of an emergency. Parents have always been concerned of the fact that in times of genuine trouble, they are not able to reach their child. Lock downs and fires are always a huge possibility during school and parents always stress that they must be the first to know the condition of their child. In case of any emergency, a student can call for help using a cell phone, arousing the awareness of others, such as teachers and students.

In addition to emergencies, schools that let students hold cell phones show a basis of trust and understanding of the student's predicament. Trust is an immense foundation that children need to learn to have and form with other individuals in society today. By letting students realize that they can be trusted, they themselves will show more respect and credence towards adults. To be responsible in life is a goal that each individual must achieve. Starting with trust, students will learn to be responsible. Their understanding of the rules and regulations that go along with privileges will be made clear and those who break such rules will face the necessary consequences.

Allowing cell phones in school during appropriate times is not necessarily a necessity, but a privilege that should be given to responsible students. For emergency purposes, the use of cell phones may lessen any casualties during schools hours. As a life goal, our community must instill trust with each other and hold the responsibilities with such privileges.

On the other hand, banning cell phones from school at any time and at any hour is another choice.

Although these policies hold different views and opinions to them, letting students carry cell phones in school should be authorized.

In any case of an emergency, students who are allowed to have a cell phone during lunch breaks and other free time can contact those in times of an emergency. Parents have always been concerned of the fact that in times of genuine trouble, they are not able to reach their child. Lock downs and fires are always a huge possibility during school and parents always stress that they must be the first to know the condition of their child. In case of any emergency, a student can call for help using a cell phone, arousing the awareness of others, such as teachers and students.

In addition to emergencies, schools that let students hold cell phones show a basis of trust and understanding of the student's predicament. Trust is an immense foundation that children need to learn to have and form with other individuals in society today. By letting students realize that they can be trusted, they themselves will show more respect and credence towards adults. To be responsible in life is a goal that each individual must achieve. Starting with trust, students will learn to be responsible. Their understanding of the rules and regulations that go along with privileges will be made clear and those who break such rules will face the necessary consequences.

Allowing cell phones in school during appropriate times is not necessarily a necessity, but a privilege that should be given to responsible students. For emergency purposes, the use of cell phones may lessen any casualties during schools hours. As a life goal, our community must instill trust with each other and hold the responsibilities with such privileges.

Therefore, the first step is to allow cell phones in school for the use of rational purposes only during specified times.

Sincerely,

Using details from the article, create an argument for or against the development of these cars.  Be sure to include: your position on driverless cars; appropriate details from the article that support your position; an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to your argumentative essay.","For many years scientist and mechanics have been trying to create a car that drives on its own. Over the years, they have come close to creating that car, and soon they'll have is made. I personally feel like it's a bad idea to create this car, even though there are some good points to it.

I get car sick, and I'm sure many people in this world get car sick too. I have found that when I drive, I don't get car sick, one reason it that I'm keeping my mind busy and focus on driving. With self driven cars I would not be driving, so I'll get car sick, I would rather walk to my destination, than get sick and dizzy because of driverless car. However, you're probably thinking ""I don't car sick."" So letting me move on. Everyday someones computer crashes, phones freeze, or their eletronic device's battery runs out. What does this have to do with the car? Well, I'm glad you asked. If this is a driverless car it is a known fact that it'll be electronic. So imagen you're driving in the high way when you're car manlfunctions and shuts down. If you can't get you're car under controll quick enough you'll crash right in to the person in front or beside you. Technology is known to fall apart and malfuntion all the time, so most likely this driverless car will cause more accidents.

This idea of a driverless car is not all bad. There are some good things about it too. For example, texting and driving will be less dangerous, drunk people will be able to drive home without worrying about crashing, or if there is a traffic jam, you don't have to worry, because the car will provide entertainment for you. It's the future now. Of course everyone wants to take things to the next level. I just don't think we're ready yet.

In conclusion. driverless cars are a bad idea because they'll cause more car crashes, make people lazier, cause many people to get car sick, including myself, and it'll do more bad than good. The car can help with many things as well . The future is bright, the next level of future things is driverless cars. But, for right now the future is doing just fine with drivers driving a car.",6091E0A4ED7B,"In conclusion. driverless cars are a bad idea because they'll cause more car crashes, make people lazier, cause many people to get car sick, including myself, and it'll do more bad than good.
