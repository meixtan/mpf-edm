In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nAssignment: \\'\\'\\'More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have onpeople. Persuade the readers to agree with you.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nGive me feedback to help me revise. Extract three to five very short excerpts from my essay and give me feedback on those. Keep your feedback very short. List the excerpts and feedback like this:\\n*[excerpt]---[feedback]\\n*[excerpt]---[feedback]\\n*[excerpt]---[feedback]\\n [/INST]  Of course! Here are some excerpts from your essay along with my feedback:\\n\\n* \"Overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health.\"---This sentence is too long and wordy. Consider breaking it up into two shorter sentences for easier comprehension.\\n* \"When people excessively use the computer, they put their safety and well being at risk.\"---This sentence is vague and doesn\\'t provide specific examples. Consider adding more details to make it more persuasive.\\n* \"Dr. @PERSON4 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION2 claims, \\'I @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 internet-related kidnappings & other crimes.\\'\"---This sentence is too long and includes too many names and numbers. Consider simplifying it for easier understanding.\\n* \"The internet hold false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 peoples time.\"---This sentence is too vague and doesn\\'t provide specific examples. Consider adding more details to make it more persuasive.\\n\\nFor your assignment, here are some excerpts from your letter along with my feedback:\\n\\n* \"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.\"---This sentence is too broad and doesn\\'t provide a clear opinion. Consider stating your opinion more clearly.\\n* \"Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.\"---This sentence is too vague and doesn\\'t provide specific examples. Consider adding more details to make it more persuasive.\\n\\nOverall, your essay and letter are well-written and present valid points. However, consider revising them to make them more concise, clear, and persuasive. Good luck!'"
