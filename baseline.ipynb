      "I have heard you are having trouble making a decision on whether students should or shouldn't be required to do community service. I know many people who do community service including myself. From personal experience of community service i can tell you that it can help the way you think and act around certain types of people and ethnic groups. I am not say there is a different way to act around others, although it would be unprofessional to act like you do with your friends around the president of the United States. Therefore all students should be required to perform community service acts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main reasons community service should be essential is because students now a days have more time to do these things and it would greatly impact our communities. For example if one student did community service by picking up trash in a near by park we could prevent people from overseeing these parks just because it is has trash every where. Another great example of community service having a big impact on our community is helping at the annual food drive. This could impact millions of people that are in dyer needs of food and you never know but you could collect 5 cans that could possibly be the difference between life or death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it may sound funny but picking up trash or collecting food at a food drive doesn't take much effort but it does leave a big impact and i know that students are age are perfectly capable of doing these small tasks.\n",

       "'<s>[INST] You are my English teacher. Read my essay and assignment:\\n\\nEssay: \\'\\'\\'Dear Principal,\\n\\nI have heard you are having trouble making a decision on whether students should or shouldn\\'t be required to do community service. I know many people who do community service including myself. From personal experience of community service i can tell you that it can help the way you think and act around certain types of people and ethnic groups. I am not say there is a different way to act around others, although it would be unprofessional to act like you do with your friends around the president of the United States. Therefore all students should be required to perform community service acts.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons community service should be essential is because students now a days have more time to do these things and it would greatly impact our communities. For example if one student did community service by picking up trash in a near by park we could prevent people from overseeing these parks just because it is has trash every where. Another great example of community service having a big impact on our community is helping at the annual food drive. This could impact millions of people that are in dyer needs of food and you never know but you could collect 5 cans that could possibly be the difference between life or death.\\n\\nI know it may sound funny but picking up trash or collecting food at a food drive doesn\\'t take much effort but it does leave a big impact and i know that students are age are perfectly capable of doing these small tasks.\\n\\nDoing such a little thing to a community could make a big difference for many people, so if i were in your shoes trying to make a decision about community service i would definitely say yes not only because i do this myself but because the people that we could be effecting need our help. Thank you for considering the following things that i have put up to offer.
