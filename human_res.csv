They think helping the community is very important. But other friends of yours think community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. 
Your principal is deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. 
Write a letter to your principal in which you take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service. Support your position with examples.","Dear Principal,

I have heard you are having trouble making a decision on whether students should or shouldn't be required to do community service. I know many people who do community service including myself. From personal experience of community service i can tell you that it can help the way you think and act around certain types of people and ethnic groups. I am not say there is a different way to act around others, although it would be unprofessional to act like you do with your friends around the president of the United States. Therefore all students should be required to perform community service acts.

One of the main reasons community service should be essential is because students now a days have more time to do these things and it would greatly impact our communities. For example if one student did community service by picking up trash in a near by park we could prevent people from overseeing these parks just because it is has trash every where. Another great example of community service having a big impact on our community is helping at the annual food drive. This could impact millions of people that are in dyer needs of food and you never know but you could collect 5 cans that could possibly be the difference between life or death.

I know it may sound funny but picking up trash or collecting food at a food drive doesn't take much effort but it does leave a big impact and i know that students are age are perfectly capable of doing these small tasks.

Doing such a little thing to a community could make a big difference for many people, so if i were in your shoes trying to make a decision about community service i would definitely say yes not only because i do this myself but because the people that we could be effecting need our help. Thank you for considering the following things that i have put up to offer. I hope your decision goes well and i know when it comes down to it u will make the right choice.

Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to do community service. It is their choice. If they want to, they should but you can not force them to do so. I also believe that you should only make students who have gotten in trouble or been bad to do community service as punishment if you want to. This will help the community and make them learn their lesson. For an illustration, if a girl or a guy gets into trouble instead of giving them detention, just make them help out the world by doing some community service. This explains that it will benefit you and your world. This also illustrates that this punishment is better because in detention, you do nothing and just keep quiet but with this, they actually do something which would make them very sore and make them never want to do it again. I believe that detention rate might go down because of this. Time is very valuable which is why community service should be a choice.

People who do community services for free I believe should feel happy with themselves and shouldn't care what other people thinks. For a demonstration, if you have done something good and you friend told that it was a waist of time, you shouldn't care what they think. This explains that if you don't care, they might stop since people will stop if you show no reaction. This also explains that people can feel happy with what they do no matter what. This is why people shouldn't care about how people judges them.

Maybe even Italy with sreets of water, or Creete with its Panama Canal.

Also if you are 18 or older this counts as military service, and when it comes down to it it's more safe to deliver suplies on a boat than be in the battle lines of war.

Plus You are helping people around the world by delivering important suplies like horses, young cows, and mules. Though you will have to feed alot of horses you'll be ok. I fed 335 horses and I was ok.

They would use less fuel and they have more flexibility than a bus. The car announces the driver when he or she have to take over. The person in the car doesn't have to do all the work because the car helps them out. Also the car is not all driverless because you can have a turn in driving the car.

The driverless cars would be so much safer. Although they would be very expensive, but they would be worth it. They alert you for many things like pulling in or out of driveways, dealing with traffic, and navigating through complicated roads. The car also alerts you when there is a problem. The cars also has cameras to watch the driver if he or she is focused on the road. This is great because there would be a less possibility of anyone getting hurt.

When you first start the process of detecting your emotions, it has to make a 3-D model of your face, and make sure all the mucles move like human muscles.

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Take a position on this issue. Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class.

First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. ",6D21E6095A62, I believe,"try to avoid personal pronouns-since you are the writer it is clear you believe this, and it sounds more confident to just state it simply and directly",146,156,1718495347598,Persuasive,4,383,F,Hispanic/Latino,1,0,1

ZWSEnnh2DoddwIXz8TEi,hs,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Using details from the article, write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.","I am going to be talking about how the use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Have you ever wondered how technolgy can sense how you are feeling? Well I am going to be explaining if I am for or against the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions.

In the text the author says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" Technology could also be very helpful for learning. The author says, ""A classroom computer could recognizd when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. He also says, ""Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" This technology could help sense if someone is in danger but they do not want to say that they are. In paragraph 5 in the text the author says, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. I do agree that technology would be valuable to read students emotional expressions.

Majority of students would say the same thing because they dislike school to some degree.

Students that have anxiety, unease or any other forms of fear would truly benefit from attending classes at home. It would not only make learning more progressive, but it would actually make learning much more fun. The ability to be free and be in place where you are comfortable in, would only make you have more motivation to want to understand and learn that criteria.

Students would also benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that they do not have to get dress or do things to get ready for school. They dont have to waste the parents time or using in exponential of energy walking to school. The amount of time you spend getting ready, switching between classes and going to school can waste a precious amount of time.

Studies have shown that students that have anxiety are prone to be unable to focus during class. The lack of focus would cause the student to be behind in the class and you wouldn't want that. Studies have also shown that students that have anxiety are one of the most talented beings. Albert Einstein and other intelligent beings that we acknowledge, were known to have some form of anxiety. Being alone and learning the criteria in your own pace only makes it easier.

If so read more to find out some more information about this device to see if you would want this at your job or school.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.

Using details from the article, create an argument for or against the development of these cars.  Be sure to include: your position on driverless cars; appropriate details from the article that support your position; an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to your argumentative essay.","I think that driverless cars are good and bad. A car that navigates its own self, doesn't need a driver to take control of it, uses less fuel, and is controlled by a computer is most likely to be our future. We all want to do greater things, invent grather things, but we should also realize that some things can be thought of but not created. A driverless car has its ups and downs because if no human being is in control it could represent a bad aspect or a bad one. One good thing that comes to the top of my head is elderly people. This would be really useful to the elderly, especially because of muscle or bone aches. It reduces the number of crashes but could also influence them. The computer or whatever is controlling the car could misfunction or something could go wrong, therefore the car could end up crashing or causing an accident. Humans have the most control on a car. They decide the speed, direction, their surrondings. A computer could do thst too but not as acurate as a human would. Yes it is a very interesting thing thst could happen in the future but are we sure that we would want a machine to take over rather than a human.

Venus one of the closest planets to Earth.

It is about the same size and density as the Earth.

Venus has a chalenging atmospher, but that wont stop people from trying to go there.

Venus is worth pursuing despite the danger it presents because it could tell humans more about the Earth, human cerosity will drive people there eventualy, and people know little about what is below the dence atmosphere.

Venus could give us as humans a greater understanding of Earth.

Venus is Earth's sisster planet.

This means that Venus is about the same density and size as Earth.

In the text the author states, ""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""

The author also states that Venus could have been coverd in water and supported some form of life.

Human cerosity will drive us to Venus at some point.

Although travling to the sister planet would be hard with its dence atmospher and its scorching heat.

Humans will eventualy find a way to travle to Venus.

In the text the author states, ""Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevors.""

This means that humans should not be limited by our doubts and dangers but humans should insted expand to meet the the cornerstone of innocation and creativity.

People know little about what is going on beneth the carbon dioxide blackets of Venus's atmosphere.

All endevors to go to the sister planet have faild.

The author explains in the text, ""No spacectaft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Also no space craft has landed on the planet for over three decades.

The isue could be the atmosphere or the highly corrosive clouds of acid.

Whatever the case it would be a monumental descovery if humans could find out what is on the surface of Venus.

In conclution Venus would be worth going to despite the many dangerious risks it presents because it could provide more insite about the Earth, human cerosity will lead people there at some point, and humans know next to none about what is going on below the Venus's atmosphere.

Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

The thought of not having to waste energy in driving and to make the experience more relaxing for the individual. It will also display the amount of intellegence and engineering it would take in order to construct such a car. However, there will be many different people who will wish to insult and bring down the idea of the driverless cars. Not only that, but there will people in the world who would wish to turn the positive idea into a negative one. It will also start to corrupt our natural human abilities. What I mean by that is humans will start to become more and more relient on having everything completed for them with minimal effort envolved. Eventually, we will start to become lazier and lazier as advancements in technology increases. One thing to note, I am not entirely against automation or self-seficient machinery. However, how could we say that we are hard working individuals when a robot will be doing the work for us? Could we truely call ourselves hard working when all we would have to do is push a button?

One major example of how this will be a problem in the future is the fact that there won't be any laws inplace of the driverless cars. Numerous states have already opposed the idea and plan to keep it that way until the cars are proven reliable. In paragraph 9, it also discusses who will be counted liable for an accident. ""...if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?""(Waiting)

Using details from the article, create an argument for or against the development of these cars.  Be sure to include: your position on driverless cars; appropriate details from the article that support your position; an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to your argumentative essay.","The author discusses the good and the bad of these cars. The author talks about how they could easily replace buses and/or other methods of transportation. Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impratical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further. For the reason that it would be much safer with drivers and we do not need to change much then.

With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themself safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require human skill rather than the car doing it all.

If we were to have these driverless cars, we might have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety. Like the author says, if someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer. Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed?

To conclude, the driverless cars should not be further developed. They could potentially put a person in danger, they would not be very cost effective, and a lot would need to be changed. We do not need to change if we already have a system that works well for the most part. The driverless cars would be pointless.",CD70501C85E3,the good and the bad ,Consider using more specific words,21,42,1718761556254,Literary Analysis,3,328,M,Hispanic/Latino,0,0,0

The author talks about how they could easily replace buses and/or other methods of transportation. Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impratical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further. For the reason that it would be much safer with drivers and we do not need to change much then.

With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themself safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require human skill rather than the car doing it all.

If we were to have these driverless cars, we might have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety.

Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed?

A1568InefhqsFCQNF83n,hs,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Take a position on this question. Support your response with reasons and specific examples.,"Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.

As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.

However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will ""slack off"" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of ""what is the effect of temperature on ice?"" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.

In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too ""obvious"" or easy.

Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher.

When all of these community services add up, we will be influences for Canfield and Boardman and other cities and they will do the same. When we come together like this, we can make a difference.

They think helping the community is very important. But other friends of yours think community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. 
Your principal is deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. 
Write a letter to your principal in which you take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service. Support your position with examples.","Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, I believe you should require all students to preform community services at SCHOOL_NAME. I believe this for many reasons. The first reason being is that there are hundreds of kids at our school, and if each person does one community service , that doesn't even have to be big, think of how that could all add up! We could be changing the community one step at a time. When I say the service doesn't have to be big, I mean the smallest things such as throwing a couple of plastic bottles in a recycling bin or picking up some litter you see on the side of the street or in you neighborhood. My second reason being is there are some elderly people in Austintown that could use some help with simple everyday things, such as getting their mail or shoveling their driveway. Just doing those little things for a neighbor or friend could leave a great impression on Austintown children. But adults aren't the only ones that need help. There are elementary school children that struggle in school, such as math or any subject at all. As sixth, seventh, and eighth graders we should be good role models and help them with their weaknesses. We could tutor them after school for an hour making sure we get progress done. I understand that some students have after school activities, such as a sport event, so they would not be required to tutor. But it would be mandatory for them to do some type of service, such as picking up litter everyday. When all of these community services add up, we will be influences for Canfield and Boardman and other cities and they will do the same. When we come together like this, we can make a difference. Some students that disagree with this may thing the community is no big deal, but it is much more bigger than they think.

I don't think it is a good idea to change the grade point average that is required to participate in sports.

Some of the players would get kicked off the team because they just have a C and that could effect the whole team.

It could also effect your school because maybe the players are just so stressed from having to try to get a B instead of just a C.

A C is still a good grade.

A C is still passing and it shows that the person may not understand but he still try's.

When I get a C its because I tried but i don't quite understand the information.

I know a lot of kids that would be happy with just a C and they actually try in class.

My friend was on the basketball team and he got decent grades.

I remember that when projects came up he would be really stressed and I would help him out with his school work.

He would try but on certain things he felt like it was just way to hard.

Imagine if he had to get B' s, he would have been all stressed all the time and it was hard for him to just to get good enough grades just to be able to play a sport that he really loved.

Some kids are stressed and they don't really have to get grades good enough to play any sport.

I try for good grades and its easy because I have all the time after school to do my homework or maybe just work on a project that will be due.

The players on the team have to go to practice and then after that they do there homework but I would think they would be tired from having to practice for about on hour.

When I am tired I don't always do my best and that could effect grades.

The players have a lot to handle and raising what grades they have to have in order to play ,may just make them quit.

It sucks when you have to quit something you love just because its way to hard to keep balance.

If you raise the grade point average it will tip the balance and make it hard to be a basketball player.

They can be useful or just a waste of time. I think there should not be driverless cars. There should not be driverless cars because driving is a huge responsiblity. I feel that even if the car has an in-car enterainment the driver will not be paying attention to the road and when the car signals for the driver to take control, the driver won't know what is going on and could even cause an accident. Leading to the conflict of who is at fault, ""the driver or the manufacturer?""

If we just keep our cars how they are now people will have to pay attention to the road. You could be paying really good attention to road but you have no idea how the other cars are. A lot of car accidents could be prevented if the driver of the car is in control at all times. People trying to invent a safe driverless car are just wasting their time.

Even if the car has a lot of safe reasons in why we should have them there will still be reasons why we shouldn't. We have had total control of our cars for the lonest time now and I feel like it is better to just play it safe and keep doing what we have been doing.

Driverless cars are very expensive to begin with. Uprgrades to public roads need to be done for the Smarter Cars to be driven on. The massive upgrades to the roads will also cost too much money.

Self driven cars still do not meet all safety measures, that's why it is illegal to drive on the road with them in most states. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. They all require the driver to drive throught work zones and around accidents. Why shouldn't the driver just drive all the time if you have to drive through little things like work zones? Driving doesn't require much skill besides being aware of your surroundings.

Almost all driving laws help secure the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Keeping these laws are best achieved with alert human drivers.

Also, if these cars were to start being more used there would have to be more laws made in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. They would have to see who would be held responsible, the driver or the manufacturer and that just makes everything more difficult. There would have to be a lot of work put into these cars being able to be used.

I feel like because this car is designed to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves the driver would be less aware while on the road and if for any reason needed to take charge of the wheel they wouldn't do it fast enough because they are not being as focused on the road as they would be with a normal car you drive yourself.

Also, if these cars were to start being more used there would have to be more laws made in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. They would have to see who would be held responsible, the driver or the manufacturer and that just makes everything more difficult. There would have to be a lot of work put into these cars being able to be used.

I don't think technology is advanced enough for a driverless car to be completely safe. Cars controlled by a person aren't even completely safe, a car controlled by a computer definitely isn't. The technology could fail and people could end up severly hurt. There could be many problems for the drivers and manufactures of these cars.

Policy 1 states that cell phones are ok during lunch and other free times but must be turned off during class time. I think I can speak for our entire school that, that is the way to go. For these reasons.

Firstly, everyone uses phones anyway and get in trouble so if it's ok then a lot more kids won't get in trouble. Meaning it won't affect there school record. Meaning they can better there education. Meaning they can design a new alternative fuel. Meaning they can change the world and it's thanks to passing this new policy.

Next, is kids want feel like there free. Look, we kids don't have many rights as it is. Our schedule is Wake up, School, homework, bed. I mean come on that's messed up. We can't access the creative side of our minds if we can't play on our phones.

Lastly , I just plainly think no phone policy is stupid. Many kids nowadays have expensive phones and if we can't use it what's the point. Most of our parents gave us the phone in order to call them if we run into trouble so if there's a fight or something going down and we don't want in then we call someone to pick us up. It's that simple.

I hope you can understand my reasoning. We the Kids of the nation deserve at least one right and that right is to enable us to use our phones.

Thank You,

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West.""

I think that performing community service should be required because it will teach students that go to our school to be kind and giving back to the community will make them feel better.

I also think it would be good because some students might think it will be fun cleaning up, and you don't have to do it alone i am sure you would be able to do it with a friend.

I also think it would be good because some students might think it will be fun cleaning up, and you don't have to do it alone i am sure you would be able to do it with a friend. I am sure it will teach them something about giving and it will teach them a life lesson. I also am a believer in community service and i thing it is fun giving back to the community like that and afterwards i fell very happy and energetic about myself.

Not all students enjoy doing community service or helping out other people. Yes it would be nice if some of them did take the time out to help. If you asked me for my option on this I would say no. For example some students might have to go home and watch their little brother/sister, and just don't have the time. While other kids might have a sport they play in and they have practice.

If you made everybody perform community service it would be crazy. Like I said before not only do students have things to do, but they might already be involved in an activity. As a student

I don't have time to do some things due to homework. Now just think would you rather for us to complete a certain amount of community service or get an education? Now once which one would you rather us do? Yes of course get an education! I know If I was you I would want my students to complete all their work, and then worry about staying after for school.

Now if the student had a little extra time maybe he/she might want to help the kids at the elementary school or even go volunteer at the animal shelter. Say a student jus got a call from their mother and it was a family emergency what do you expect them to do then? Yea giving back by helping another by student is a good idea, but not all kids have the time. Once again TEACHER_NAME my opinion on all students have to do community service is no.

Community Service is a very important aspect of life.

As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service.

As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians?

Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God.

I have done community service with my peers and during my experiences, I have encountered many people from various ages, genders, races, and social classes.

From every trip I have gained a valuable experience.

During one of my experiences, I was working in a soup kitchen in downtown Cleveland.

Although intimidating at first, I helped by serving those who didn't have the same gifts I am blessed with.

Isn't that what we are called to do?

Serve others like Jesus did?

I learned from this that every human person is valuable and should be treated with dignity and respect.

Wouldn't you like all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in such a great journey of faith and attempt to carry out what we are taught by Jesus Christ?

I believe by helping our society to become a better place is why we are put here on this earth, but we shouldn't be wasting our time and talents by selfishly keeping our gifts to ourself.

We are called to share those gifts with others.

I believe by helping our society to become a better place is why we are put here on this earth, but we shouldn't be wasting our time and talents by selfishly keeping our gifts to ourself.

We are called to share those gifts with others.

Simply, I am asking that you implement at least ten hours of community service for the entire school year.

That is only a little over an hour of community service per month.

By doing this, we will come closer to God and to those around us.

Sincerely,

Although, students can be creative in making summer projects for themselves, teachers are better equipped for this task. A teacher makes lesson plans all year so students can learn and pass semester exams. Summer projects can be a cool and fun way to learn. For example, students can create a big poster or PowerPoint displaying all of the things they have learned in school that year. If a student were to create a summer project then they might take it easy on themselves instead of doing something challenging. However, a teacher will give their students a challenge so they can think and problem solve.

Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

She would like to hear the students' views on this possible policy change. Write a letter to your principal arguing for or against requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Be sure to support your arguments with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

You asked for student's opinions on the subject of the new school rule that concerns whether students should be able to participate in after-school activities or sports if they have a C or lower average. I do think this is a good idea. This new rule can be a motivation for students who slack off in school, and now they can have a reason to work harder.

A grade of a C is a passing grade, so students think it's all right to not work any harder because they're already passing. However, a C is not what students should strive for. Taking away privileges, such as after-school activities or sports, is an excellent way to make students work harder to get a B. However, I do think you should either allow them to go to study sessions or start study groups to help them achieve and maintain a B or an A.

In addition, this would help our whole school learn things faster, because students will have to work to receive maintain a B or an A, unlike when they had a C. Although this might cause the sports teams or school clubs to lose members, I think it is worth it. I believe that students should be more concerned about their grades than their clubs or sports. I also think that parents would be more proud of their children for trying harder in school because of the motivation.

Also, teachers would be happier with the students because they are working harder. If the students pay more attention in class and do their homework, and stay after for extra help, the teachers will be happier and more encouraging because the students are trying hard. Furthermore, the students with a C average will learn that they have to work hard to achieve a goal, and that maintaining a B or an A average takes work and determination.

Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Students around the world say that they hate school and rather stay home well, here's and option students finally can. There is an ongoing debate that students should take online classes rather than being in school. Those who disagree state students should go to school because they will meet new people and it would improve their social skills but this is not true. Although some may disagree it would be more beneficial for students to participate in online classes.

They are various reasons why students should participate in online classes. Students would have less behavior problems because, they are not around other students to cause problems. Also, it would be more likely for students to pay attention if they don't have as many distractions that being in school causes. Students would be in their houses so, it would be easier for them to stay focus and stop them from causing disruptions.

Use specific details and examples in your response.","One summer afternoon, a boy named Generic_Name asked his mom if he could go to the park. She agreed, but told him not to stay out too late. Generic_Name informed his dad about going out and he said to travel with a few of his friends, due to kidnappings in the area he didn't want Generic_Name to be alone at the park. Generic_Name also told his older brother about him leaving the house for a bit and he said to watch the area for anything suspicious and that if he did see something, that Generic_Name and his friends should head home immediately. Thanks to his family, Generic_Name and his friends got home safe and sound. Listening to multiple opinions can help people make safer and smarter decisions.

The first example is that multiple opinions can help you make safer choices. Like with Generic_Name, going out with people you know is a great way to stay safe. Doing things in broad daylight helps as well. Unfortunately many kidnappings and random shootings are happening presently. Following all of this advice could help a simple walk to the corner store just that much safer.

Secondly, taking in multiple opinions help people make smarter decisions too. Referring back to the introduction when Generic_Name's brother told him to survey the area and watch for any strange activity was an amazing idea. Watching for people that are acting out of the ordinary is a helpful tip, because if that person were to do something weird knowing who exactly it is your getting away from is a good thing. You also always want to know where you are at all times. It's also important to know where every exit and entrance available in any public setting.

In summary, listening to the advice of multiple people is a way to stay safe and make educated decisions. If Generic_Name were to just leave the house without speaking to his dad or brother, who knows what could have happened. The safety of you and your peers is a major priority. Everyone should get a second opinion on as many things as possible. ",B4BD4DD677AD,store just ,sentence structure needs revising,1060,1071,1718985322005,Persuasive,4,348,F,Black/African American,1,0,0

Here's and idea if some students get in trouble say for littering or for bullying, getting into fights, never turn in the homework, are disrespectful and disruptive to the teacher and to the class then they could do community service for 2 days or so it could depend on how bad the case was. Cleaning up the environment and making a better situation out of something would maybe make them realize what they have done and they may not do it anymore.

For people that would like to do community service maybe you could get them to have their friends that don't want to do it try it. They could let them know that it makes you feel good about yourself and makes you feel like you just helped a lot. And maybe they will even end up liking it a lot you could create a little club for the people that like it and have them make posters for community service and on them say you could get extra credit, letters of recommendation, and be recognized with the group that they are doing the service with.

But also the people that don't want to do it you could just ask maybe say here try something new you might like making the community cleaner or a better place.

Here's and idea if some students get in trouble say for littering or for bullying, getting into fights, never turn in the homework, are disrespectful and disruptive to the teacher and to the class then they could do community service for 2 days or so it could depend on how bad the case was. Cleaning up the environment and making a better situation out of something would maybe make them realize what they have done and they may not do it anymore.

For people that would like to do community service maybe you could get them to have their friends that don't want to do it try it. They could let them know that it makes you feel good about yourself and makes you feel like you just helped a lot. And maybe they will even end up liking it a lot you could create a little club for the people that like it and have them make posters for community service and on them say you could get extra credit, letters of recommendation, and be recognized with the group that they are doing the service with.

So i hope you take this letter and think about what choice you will pick on your little conflict.

Dear principal,

I hear that you are deciding whether or not to make community service required in our school. I don't think that you should do this and I have many reasons why.

My first reason is that doing community service is supposed to make you feel good and make you feel like your doing something really nice out of the goodness of your heart. However, by making students do community service you are going to take that feeling away. They will be forced to do it and will not feel accomplished. They will feel like its a chore. When they grow up and they aren't required to do community service anymore they probably won't. As where a student who is not forced to do community service will probably grow up not thinking of it as a chore. They probably have a better chance of doing community service when they grow up too.

My second reason is that when children are forced to do something they don't do it as well as they could've. They will act spoiled and will not even bother to help in the community service. They will treat it like a chore and not even care about what there doing or how there doing it. They will cause a problem and may hurt someone. You have to want it and if you don't than your not going to work hard for it.

My third and final reason as to why I think you shouldn't make us all do community service is simply because me and my fellow classmates need to figure this stuff out on our own. Just as you and your family did.

We need to learn that life isn't all about us. We need to learn that we can't be selfish, and we have to think of other less fortunate people who can't afford anything we have and that we have to help them. Or we have to clean up the town a little. You have to let us figure this out on our own. Just as everybody else did. It will help us in the end.

These are all of the reasons why I strongly believe that you should not require us to do community service. I thank you for taking the time to read this message and hope that you will make a good decision.

How are you doing today? I would like to give you my opinion on kids doing community service. I think it is a good idea for kids to do community service despite what they want to do. Community service shows discipline, dedication, and leadership. Today I will be explaining why I think community service should be required for all students. Please sit back, relax, and read along.

The first reason why I think students should be required to do community is because it teaches discipline. It teaches discipline because it keeps you focus and not letting you get caught up. For example, there is so many negative things going on these days, and if you are doing something good with your time, you don't have time for the negativity. It also shows discipline because community service is something that you have to do consisting, so community service is something that you have to do, and be dedicated to doing it. This is my first reason why I think all students should be required to do community service.

Next, community service teaches students how to be a good citizen. By doing community service for along time, eventually students will start picking up trash, helping people, and things like that when their not doing community service. They do those things because that is just the person they have become from doing community service. Community service teaches a lot of good things and how to be good citizen is one of them. Citizenship is a great quality to have.

NASA is sending humans to study Venus to figure out what kinds of material they need to send a spacecraft to Venus and explore it. In Paragraph 5 its says, ""NASA's possible soultion to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide which is not good for human, so they would need much more material for the human to survive with all that carbon dioxide. Scientists are seeking to condut a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk (Paragraph 6).

NASA is working on studying more about Venus, but it's still risky for humans and spacecraft. NASA is now testing simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested on Venus's surface and has lasted about 3 weeks in such condition. In such heat the material should be liquefy because of extreme heat. It won't be easy but NASA is trying to make it survivalbe for humans.

The cars aren't compeletly driverless; they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? your probably asking, although, the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires such as navigating through work zones and around accidents, until then they are free to text with a cell phone, call someone withour stoping. In this way, the driverless car is actually a safety feature.

How the car does this is with position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.

But the most important piece is the LIDAR(spinning sensor on the roof), it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all is necessary for the driverless car to replicate the skill of a person at the wheel.

Even when the car require the driver aid, displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays.

Over all I see benfit in having driverless cars, They driverless cars allow us to complete as task such as putting on make up or text messaging someone, but they can still allow us to take over if needed.

Your idea about all students having to do community service is a wonderful idea. Now of days people just throw stuff on the ground thinking its not a big deal, but it is.

If students get involved it'll make the world or there town cleaner. then plants, and animals won't die from the waste that comes from the garbage. if you want students to do community service I'm okay with this idea.

It will make them fe if a student wants to go to collage but does not have the grades or the money but they are good enough at sports to get an athletic scholarship then why shouldn't they. but with this policy a student my be left with nothing because they did not have the grades to get on the team even thought they are passing all of there class's.

i think that this policy is not fear to all the people on a school team. A good player that likes the team and wants to be a part of it is taken of just because they do not have a B average. while a player that does not really want to be on the team and does not try his hardest is left on the team just because he qualifies for the grades.

Use specific details and examples to convince others to support your position.","Should students be forced to take an extracurricular activity? I don't take they should for many reasons. Taking extracurricular activities can increase work and responsibility, take time away from more important areas, or even cause stress. A student should only take an extracurricular activity if they know that they'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can negatively affect the student in many ways.

Taking an extracurricular activity means more work, and considering the amount of work students already have, it can be overwhelming. Many students won't be able to complete all their assignments because of the extra activity. This can lead to lower grades and worst performance in other classes. Not only will students have more work, they will also have to manage their time in order to be able to consistently participate or show up for that activity.

You might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong, but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. When students take extracurricular activities, they take away from their free time in order to put it in their schedule. Students use their free time to do their homework, relax from work, or spend with their family. This is pretty important for a student, considering that this may stress them out.

We also would play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and even play games to pass the time. It was a fun time.

Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. 
Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.
Write a letter to your principal convincing her which policy you believe is better. Support your position with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.

Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost ""dared"" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.

The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.

One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.

I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.

The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.

One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.

I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.

Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. 
Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.
Write a letter to your principal convincing her which policy you believe is better. Support your position with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.

Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost ""dared"" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.

I think we students should at least have a B average to play sports, that would make it fair for who tries their best in school, but i bet that those who really love sports would try their best in all their classes. Students who do not try their be st and don't like sports they could just stay with whatever grade they get because they deserve it. Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade.

If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average. All students have to do is listen in class and pass all the test that teachers give out so you could pass the class and be able to pass your class and you'll be able to play what ever sport you want.

Students and people who try their best will always get everything they want because they do everything said and everything they tell them to do. doing everything they ask you to do will make you a good person. If you try your best you will get to play sports and join in activities you like. Your decision depends on you if you make a good decision you will get what you want if you don't you don't get everything that you want.

However, even if they won't be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely.

In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever it's taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals. ",49F54A35F6F3,Students will become better individuals. ,"I really like this ending because it explains why it matters that students become better communicators, have better concentration and develop time management.

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Take a position on this issue. Support your response with reasons and examples.,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to take classes from home?

I believe that if students had to make the decision to take classes online or come to school, they would most likely pick school but personally i'd be the one taking the online classes. Besides some of the teens nowadays would recommend online, but then again the middle school and below would rather be at school because they are younger and into school while teens prefer to be at work or hanging out with an friend. Therefore that opportunity would have defiantly been token advantage of well by the teens. Because the younger kids arent really to worried about being home or hanging out because all of there friends and fun are at school not at home.

In my opinion, high school should be online classes only; Because at this point if you look at the results on how many children actually come to school when theyre in high school vs when theyre in middle school/elementary it would be a big difference in attendance records. everyone would literally be passing because its online an you dont have to come to school you can literally lay in your bed and do your work. Besides your gonna have a lot of time on your hands because your not in a school you dont have to switch classes, eat lunch, go to the locker, class changes none of that so you have a lot of time to complete all of your work.

So therefore if my school offered online classes, that would be greatly token advantage of by me and most of the students that go here.

I know many very smart students who have difficulty with a certain subject. they care about getting a good grade, and want to do well. Not many of the se people play sports, but this new policy you have proposed will still affect them. Many students have a 'C', and they just need to get better help for that.

Blood flow increases cognitive activity, which will help students achieve better grades because they will understand the subject matter better.

I feel that sometimes the can use it a little to much during school.

This would be a lot better than just getting rid of cell phones completely.

As principal you might want to consider possibly figuring out a schedule were students have free time during a couple of their classes.

Doing this would not only help the new policy, but keep it going throughout the school year.

students would appreciate it if during a boring class they got a 5-15 minute break to relax and use their phones.

But, there would be some rules behind the free time.

You would have to think of them so that students wouldn't be doing stuff that is against school rules.

My first reason why I think it was just a natural landform is becasue first of all I am a scientist and I'm not suppose to think aliens and that kind of stuff exist. Secondly, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia for the first time all they saw was just a natural landform. One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. My last reason is becasue with the 3D high-resolution images from NASA's MGS it shows that it was just a mesa.

Those were all my reasons why I think it was a natural landform not an alien. Hopefully now you agree with me and think it was just a natural landform too.

She would like to hear the students' views on this possible policy change. Write a letter to your principal arguing for or against requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Be sure to support your arguments with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

The school policy has always stated that you can play sports or participate in activities, as long as you are passing every class. Many students are trying really hard to at least make a C average in every class, just because they are athletic and they want to play sports. The athletic students are the ones that usually struggle in school because they do not have as much time to study, because sports are so time consuming. The majority of the school makes a C average, changing the policy to having to make at least a B average is not going to make kids do better in school, it is just going to persuade the kids not to play school sports.

If you change the policy, volleyball, track, tennis, football, and many other sports will have less kids and a smaller chance of winning.

The two terms given are policies that both have reasonable pros and cons to each subject. Allowing students to bring phones to school and obligating them to use such devices during lunch periods and free times as long as the phones are off during teaching periods is one possibility. On the other hand, banning cell phones from school at any time and at any hour is another choice.

Although these policies hold different views and opinions to them, letting students carry cell phones in school should be authorized.

In any case of an emergency, students who are allowed to have a cell phone during lunch breaks and other free time can contact those in times of an emergency. Parents have always been concerned of the fact that in times of genuine trouble, they are not able to reach their child. Lock downs and fires are always a huge possibility during school and parents always stress that they must be the first to know the condition of their child. In case of any emergency, a student can call for help using a cell phone, arousing the awareness of others, such as teachers and students.

In addition to emergencies, schools that let students hold cell phones show a basis of trust and understanding of the student's predicament. Trust is an immense foundation that children need to learn to have and form with other individuals in society today. By letting students realize that they can be trusted, they themselves will show more respect and credence towards adults. To be responsible in life is a goal that each individual must achieve. Starting with trust, students will learn to be responsible. Their understanding of the rules and regulations that go along with privileges will be made clear and those who break such rules will face the necessary consequences.

Allowing cell phones in school during appropriate times is not necessarily a necessity, but a privilege that should be given to responsible students.

Using details from the article, write an essay evaluating how well the author supports this idea. Be sure to include: a claim that evaluates how well the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers; an explanation of the evidence from the article that supports your claim; an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to your essay.","Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system and is extremely dangerous and deadly, but is also the planet that most like Earth. The author of the article supports his idea that going to Venus is a great idea reasonably well, although he doesn't use that much information to prove his claim. The author states a lot of the dangers of going to Venus and then addresses his points of wanting to study Venus more closely.

The author tells the reader that many Astronomers are fascinated with Venus because some people have a theory that Venus was once like Earth. He states that in Venus's past it might have been covered largely with oceans and could've had life on it, just like earth. The author even states that Venus still has some features on it that Earth has such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author also decribes that Venus could sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. The author uses examples of technology that could help us research more about Venus, such as NASA's blimp-like vehicle which could allow scientists to float above the carbon dioxide littered atmosphere, but most of his points about technology wouldn't work because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, which would make most forms of photographs and videos ineffective.

The author of this article claims that Venus is worth the cost and risk just to learn more about it but doesn't support his claim well enough to presuade the reader to agree with him. He backs up technology that wouldn't work because of the atmosphere surrounding Venus and doesn't show ways how we can get past the deadly atmosphere without risk. The author doesn't show enough reason that scientist should study Venus besides that it might have closely resembled Earth in the past.",2D2E11A4632B, T,You need a sentence introducing the text here.,131,133,1719772246969,Literary Analysis,3,303,M,White,0,0,0

This is beneficial so students can complete the task faster and revise with their peers, leading to students having overall better projects and better grades.
